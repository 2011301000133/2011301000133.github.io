课程分为七个部分
- PROBABILITY
- POISSON PROCESSES
- FINITE-STATE MARKOV CHAINS
- RENEWAL PROCESSES
- COUNTABLE-STATE MARKOV CHAINS
- MARKOV PROCESSES WITH COUNTABLE STATE SPACES
- RANDOM WALKS, LARGE DEVIATIONS, AND MARTINGALES



## PROBABILITY
The core concept in probability theory is that of a **probability model**
- first component **sample points**
- second component **events** 是所有 sample 的子集的集合
- probability measure。满足非负、可加、全集对应1
