heapq 模块提供堆算法，官方文档写的很好，摘抄下来：  


>This module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.  
Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. This implementation uses arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, heap[0].
