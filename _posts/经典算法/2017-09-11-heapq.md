heapq 模块提供堆算法，[官方文档](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/heapq.html?highlight=heapq)写的很好，摘抄下来(对格式和段落进行了整理)：  

## NAME:  
>This module provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm.  

## DESCRIPTION
>Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children. This implementation uses arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k, counting elements from zero. For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite. The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, heap[0].

## functions  

### heapq.heappush(heap, item)
Push the value item onto the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.

### heapq.heappop(heap)
Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised. To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].

### heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
Push item on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the heap. The combined action runs more efficiently than heappush() followed by a separate call to heappop().

### heapq.heapify(x)
Transform list x into a heap, in-place, in linear time.

### heapq.heapreplace(heap, item)
Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, and also push the new item. The heap size doesn’t change. If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised.

This one step operation is more efficient than a heappop() followed by heappush() and can be more appropriate when using a fixed-size heap. The pop/push combination always returns an element from the heap and replaces it with item.

The value returned may be larger than the item added. If that isn’t desired, consider using heappushpop() instead. Its push/pop combination returns the smaller of the two values, leaving the larger value on the heap.

The module also offers three general purpose functions based on heaps.
